    <h2>Welcome to My Page</h2>
    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>My name is <b>Jakub Brzeski</b> and I am in <i>9th Grade</i>. I am 14 years old and my birthday is on July 7th, 2011. I live in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey and I have been living there for about 10 years. Something about me is that I enjoy hanging out with friends and family. They support me and make me who I am. I would describe myself as outgoing.</p>

<h2>My Interests</h2>
<h3>Favorite hobby:</h3>
<p>I have a couple favorite hobbies but one of them is playing <strong>tennis</strong>. I've been playing tennis since <em>2021</em> and I enjoy it very well. I enjoy it because it is a solo or double sport so most of the outcome is caused by <strong>you</strong>. Unlike a team sport where not only you and one other person determine the outcome of the game. Tennis is very meaningful to me because in the past 4 years of my life it has played a big part in it.</p> 
<h3>Other things I like</h3>
<p>Besides tennis, I enjoy to do many other things. Such as <strong>working out</strong>. I also enjoy listening to <em>music</em>. <em>Music</em> puts me in a good mood even when I'm not in one. Also I can listen to music <em>while</em> im working out so its like two of the things I like <strong>together</strong>. Another interest I have is playing video games. I play games like Roblox, Valorant, Minecraft, and Fortnite.</p>
